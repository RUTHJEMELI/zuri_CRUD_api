Project Overview
Zuri_task_two_project is an API for managing user data. Users can be retrieved, added, updated, and deleted using this API. The primary purpose of this project is to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for user data based on their unique user IDs.

Assumptions
The ID of every user is known and used to retrieve data.
Each user knows their unique user ID.
User IDs are unique and do not repeat across users.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
MongoDB installed and running.
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone [repository_url]

Navigate to the project directory:
cd [project_directory]
Install project dependencies:
npm install
Create a .env file in the project root directory to store environment variables. Include the following configuration:
dotenv
# Database connection URL (Replace with your MongoDB connection URL)
CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:4000/your_database_name

# Port for the API server
PORT=3000
Start the API server:
npm start
The API should now be running locally on port 3000 (or the port specified in your .env file).

Usage
API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints for managing user data:

GET /api/:user_id: Retrieve a user by their ID.
POST /api/ Add a new user.
PUT /api/:user_id: Update a user's information by their ID.
DELETE /:user_id: Delete a user by their ID.
For each endpoint, replace :id with the unique user ID.

Deployment
To deploy this API in a production environment, follow these steps:

Host your MongoDB database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
Set up environment variables for production in your hosting environment.
Deploy the API to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Azure, render and any of your choice.).
Update the database connection URL in your production environment.
Ensure proper security measures (e.g., authentication and authorization) are in place to protect user data.
